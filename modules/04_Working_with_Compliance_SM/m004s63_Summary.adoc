Transcript:

In this module, you learned the following:

* Variables let you reuse values in Ansible Playbooks, inventory files, tasks, and roles, as well as Jinja2 templates.
* Variables can be written as Python dictionaries that can be browsed or searched.
* When a variable is the first element to start a value, double quotation marks are mandatory.
* The `register` keyword can be used to capture the output of a command in a variable.
* Ansible facts are variables that are automatically discovered by Ansible from a managed host.
* You can use `include_vars` modules to include variable files in JSON format in playbooks.
* You can use `loops` to iterate with a specified number of items. 
* Certain return values are common to all modules.
