Transcript:

A host inventory defines the hosts that Ansible manages. Hosts may belong to groups that are typically used to identify the host's role in the datacenter. A host can be a member of more than one group.

There are two ways in which host inventories can be defined. A _static_ host inventory is defined by a text file, while a _dynamic_ host inventory is generated from outside providers.
